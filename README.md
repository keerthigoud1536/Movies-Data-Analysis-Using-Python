# 🎬 Movies Data Analysis Using Python

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on performing **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on a movies dataset to uncover trends related to movie genres, ratings, budgets, and revenues. The goal is to derive **actionable insights** that help understand factors influencing movie performance and audience preferences.

The project emphasizes **data cleaning, visualization, and insight generation**, making it suitable for **Data Analyst and Data Scientist** roles.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze trends in movie ratings, genres, and revenue
- Understand the relationship between **budget, revenue, and popularity**
- Identify high-performing genres and time-based patterns
- Support **data-driven decision-making** using insights


## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset contains information such as:
- Movie title
- Genre
- Budget
- Revenue
- Release year
- Ratings
- Popularity score


## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- **Libraries:** pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

## 🔍 Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing and inconsistent values
- Removed duplicate records
- Converted data types for analysis
- Standardized categorical variables (genres, years)

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Key analyses performed:
- Genre-wise movie count and revenue distribution
- Budget vs Revenue relationship
- Rating trends over time
- Popularity and revenue correlation
- Identification of top-performing movies and genres

Visualizations were used extensively to communicate findings clearly.

## 📈 Key Insights
- High-budget movies generally show higher revenue, but **budget alone does not guarantee success**
- Certain genres consistently outperform others in revenue and audience ratings
- Movie ratings show noticeable variation across genres and release periods
- Popularity has a strong correlation with revenue performance
